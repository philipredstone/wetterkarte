                <p>
                    If you have given consent to data processing, we process
                    your personal data based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR or
                    Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR if special categories of data are
                    processed according to Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR. In the case of
                    explicit consent for the transfer of personal data to third
                    countries, data processing is also based on Art. 49 para. 1
                    lit. a GDPR. If you consent to the storage of cookies or
                    access to information on your end device (e.g., via device
                    fingerprinting), data processing is also based on § 25 para.

                    measures, we process your data based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit.
                    b GDPR. We also process your data if it is required to
                    fulfill a legal obligation based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c
                    GDPR. Data processing can also be based on our legitimate
                    interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.
                    Information on the specific legal basis applicable in each
                    case is provided in the following sections of this privacy

                <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
                <p>
                    In the course of our business activities, we work with
                    various external parties. This may also involve the transfer
                    of personal data to these external parties. We only share
                    personal data with external parties if it is necessary to
                    fulfill a contract, if we are legally obliged to do so
                    (e.g., transferring data to tax authorities), if we have a
                    legitimate interest in sharing data according to Art. 6
                    para. 1 lit. f GDPR, or if another legal basis permits the
                    transfer. When we use processors, we only transfer personal
                    data based on a valid data processing agreement. In the case
                    of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is
                    concluded.

                    Many data processing operations are only possible with your
                    explicit consent. You can revoke your consent at any time.
                    The legality of the data processing carried out before the
                    revocation remains unaffected.

                <p>
                    Our internet pages use so-called "cookies." Cookies are
                    small data packets that do no harm to your device. They are
                    either temporarily stored for the duration of a session
                    (session cookies) or permanently stored on your device
                    (permanent cookies). Session cookies are automatically
                    deleted after your visit. Permanent cookies remain on your
                    device until you delete them yourself or they are
                    automatically deleted by your web browser.

                <p>
                    Cookies can be set by us (first-party cookies) or by
                    third-party companies (so-called third-party cookies).
                    Third-party cookies enable the integration of certain
                    services provided by third-party companies within websites
                    (e.g., cookies for processing payment services).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cookies serve various purposes. Many cookies are technically
                    necessary, as certain website functions would not work
                    without them (e.g., the shopping cart function or the
                    display of videos). Other cookies can be used to analyze
                    user behavior or for advertising purposes.

                    Cookies required for the electronic communication process,
                    for the provision of certain functions you desire (e.g., the
                    shopping cart function), or for optimizing the website
                    (e.g., cookies to measure web audience) are stored based on
                    Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR unless another legal basis is
                    specified. The website operator has a legitimate interest in
                    storing necessary cookies to ensure the technically
                    error-free and optimized provision of its services. If
                    consent to the storage of cookies and comparable recognition
                    technologies has been requested, processing is based
                    exclusively on this consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and
                    § 25 para. 1 TDDDG); consent can be revoked at any time.

                    If you contact us by email, phone, or fax, your inquiry,
                    including all personal data resulting from it (name,

                    without your consent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit.
                    b GDPR if your request is related to the performance of a
                    contract or necessary for the implementation of
                    pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, processing is
                    based on our legitimate interest in the effective handling
                    of inquiries addressed to us (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) or
                    on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) if this has
                    been requested; consent can be revoked at any time.

                <p>
                    The data you send to us through contact inquiries remains
                    with us until you request deletion, revoke your consent to
                    storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies
                    (e.g., after your request has been processed). Mandatory
                    legal provisions – especially statutory retention periods –
                    remain unaffected.

                <p>
                    We use Cloudflare Turnstile (hereinafter "Turnstile") on
                    this website. The provider is Cloudflare Inc., 101 Townsend
                    St., San Francisco, CA 94107, USA (hereinafter
                    "Cloudflare").
                </p>
                <p>
                    Turnstile is used to check whether data entered on this
                    website (e.g., in a contact form) is being entered by a
                    human or by an automated program. To do this, Turnstile
                    analyzes the behavior of the website visitor based on
                    various characteristics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website
                    visitor enters a website with Turnstile enabled. Turnstile
                    evaluates various information for this analysis (e.g., IP
                    address, time spent on the website, or mouse movements made
                    by the user). The data collected during the analysis is
                    forwarded to Cloudflare.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The storage and analysis of the data are based on Art. 6
                    para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate
                    interest in protecting its web offerings from abusive
                    automated surveillance and spam. If consent has been
                    requested, the processing is based exclusively on Art. 6
                    para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 para. 1 TDDDG, insofar as the
                    consent covers the storage of cookies or access to
                    information on the user's end device (e.g., device
                    fingerprinting). Consent can be revoked at any time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data processing is based on standard contractual
                    clauses, which can be found here: <a
